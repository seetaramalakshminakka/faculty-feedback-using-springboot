# Faculty Feedback System

## Overview
The Faculty Feedback System is a Spring Boot-based project designed to streamline the process of collecting and analyzing feedback for faculty members. The application features two distinct user roles: **Admin** and **Student**, each with specific functionalities. 

The backend is developed using **Spring Boot** and **STS (Spring Tool Suite)**, while the frontend is created using **Visual Studio Code (VSCode)**. **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)** is implemented to integrate the frontend and backend seamlessly.

## Features
### Admin Features:
- Add Faculty
- Delete Faculty
- Modify Faculty Information
- View Faculty Performance

### Student Features:
- Login using a common username and password
- Provide feedback for selected faculty members
- Feedback is directly linked to the corresponding facultyâ€™s performance data

This system helps faculty members identify areas for improvement based on student feedback.
